# phpsimplechatapp
**tbh not the most impressive projects ive ever done (with udemy courses or myself) but it serves as an exercise and shows an idea of how chat app can work. It has some nice touches too, you can send message pressing enter, just not an empty one, but when you press both enter and shift you create newline character, just like in chrome dev REPL for example. These are small things but have impact on overall user experience**

**EDIT: http is stateless so it uses intervals and ajax... Thats one way to get chat app. Now im working on chat app using websockets in node. I think thats better approach.**
